Advent of Code 2022 

Hideous throwaway code to solve the Advent of Code for 2022.

## My personal rules

Different people play Advent of Code in different ways; here's
how I do it:

 - It's all about fun.
 - No hints or help, beyond what's in the problem description and
    examples.  If I can't figure it out without hints or going to
    reddit or elsewhere, then I don't deserve the star.
 - Code is "pure" Python3, unless it's more fun not to.  Often it's
    more fun to rewrite what I need, and sometimes it actuallys saves
    time to do so because reading through the documentation takes time,
    because I only remember about 2% of what numpy/scipy can do, etc.
    - I only remember about 50% of Python3, for that matter, so
      sometimes I do things the hard way for no good reason.
 - I don't care much about how efficient the solution is; brute force
    is often perfectly adequate (although there are exceptions, like
    day 11, where if you don't do things in an efficient way your
    code will run for eons before it completes).
 - Elegance and maintainability are optional.  This code is intended
    to be run once, checked in, and abandoned.  (Of course I'll keenly
    regret this if it turns out that the solution to some later problem
    depends on the code I wrote for the earlier problems, but so
    far there hasn't been any hint of that.)
    - If I do something neat, or some ghastly shortcut, or make a
	simplifying assumption, I will comment it.
